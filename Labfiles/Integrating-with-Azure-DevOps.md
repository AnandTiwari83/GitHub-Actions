# Lab 6: Integrating with Azure DevOps

Azure Boards is a powerful tool within the Azure DevOps suite designed to help teams plan, track, and manage their work. Integrating Azure Boards with GitHub can significantly enhance project management by linking development activities with planning and tracking workflows. Here's how this integration can benefit your team and the steps to set it up:

### Benefits of Integrating Azure Boards with GitHub

- **Unified Workflow**: Sync work items and pull requests between Azure Boards and GitHub, ensuring that all team members have visibility into progress and issues, regardless of the platform they use.
- **Automated Linking**: Automatically link GitHub commits and pull requests to work items in Azure Boards. This creates traceability from code changes to project tasks.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Teams can use GitHub for source control and collaboration while leveraging Azure Boards for work item tracking, providing a seamless experience across both platforms.
- **Improved Planning and Tracking**: Plan sprints, track progress, and manage backlogs in Azure Boards while developers continue to use GitHub for their code repositories.

In this exercise, you'll explore Azure boards and Azure test plans. Azure Boards provides software development teams with the interactive and customizable tools they need to manage their software projects. Azure Test Plans provide rich and powerful tools everyone in the team can use to drive quality and collaboration throughout the development process. The easy-to-use, browser-based test management solution provides all the capabilities required for planned manual testing.

### Task 1: Connect the Azure Board with GitHub

In this task, you'll connect your Azure DevOps project's board to your GitHub repository using the Azure Boards app for GitHub to support the integration between Azure Boards and GitHub. This app is free for both public and private repositories. You'll also explore work items.  In this task, you'll make changes in GitHub, link a PR to Azure boards using syntax, and monitor the work item.

1. In your browser, open Azure DevOps by navigating to the below URL:

    ``` 
    https://dev.azure.com/
