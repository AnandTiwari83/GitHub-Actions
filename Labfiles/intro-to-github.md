# What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, at its core. The GitHub platform simplifies the process of collaborating on projects and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together.

As we learned earlier GitHub provides an AI powered developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. Let’s break down each one of the core pillars of the GitHub Enterprise platform, AI, Collaboration, Productivity, Security and Scale.

### Benefits of Using GitHub

1. **Collaboration:** GitHub makes it easy for multiple developers to work together on a project, regardless of their physical location. With features like branches, pull requests, and code reviews, teams can work in parallel without interfering with each other's work.

2. **Version Control:** Every change made to a project is tracked and recorded, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed. This history of changes is valuable for understanding how a project has evolved.

3. **Community and Open Source:** GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects. Developers can contribute to these projects, learn from each other, and showcase their work to the global developer community.

4. **Integration:** GitHub integrates with numerous tools and services, from continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to project management and code review tools, streamlining the development workflow.

## Key Features of GitHub

1. **What is a repository?**
    - A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. It is one of the essential parts that helps you collaborate with people. You can use repositories to manage your work, track changes, store revision history and work with others. Before we dive too deep, let’s first start with how to create a repository.

2. **What are commits**
    - A **commit** is a change to one or more files on a branch. Every time a commit is created, it's assigned a unique ID and tracked, along with the time and contributor. Commits provide a clear audit trail for anyone reviewing the history of a file or linked item, such as an issue or pull request.

3. **Branches:** Branching lets you diverge from the main line of development to work on a separate version of your project. You can create a branch, make changes, and then merge it back into the main branch when your changes are ready.

4. **Pull Requests:** Pull requests are proposals to merge changes from one branch into another. They are a core feature for collaboration, allowing you to discuss changes, review code, and ensure everything is ready before integrating the changes into the main project.

5. **Forking:** Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

6. **GitHub Issues:** Issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, and bugs for your projects. They help you manage and prioritize work, discuss ideas, and keep track of tasks.
