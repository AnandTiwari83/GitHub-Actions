# GitHub Actions Hands-On Lab

Welcome to the GitHub Actions Workshop! This workshop is designed to help you understand and implement GitHub Actions effectively in your projects. Whether you're new to GitHub Actions or looking to enhance your existing knowledge, this workshop covers a range of topics to get you started and take your workflows to the next level.

## Workflow Setup

In this, you'll learn the fundamentals of GitHub Actions and workflow files. We'll cover how to trigger workflows with events like pushes and pull requests, define jobs and steps within workflows, and set up a basic CI workflow for testing code on every push.

## Action Integration

In this, focuses on incorporating pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace and creating custom actions for reusable tasks. 

## GitHub Environments

This is lab is about configuring GitHub Environments. GitHub environments in GitHub Actions allow you to define and manage deployment environments like development, staging, and production. They include protection rules such as required reviewers, wait times, and environment-specific secrets to enhance security and control. This ensures deployments are consistent and secure, with safeguards for each stage of the process.

## Advanced Workflows

In this topics like coding standards, secure coding practices, code review processes, version control systems, automated testing strategies, CI/CD practices, secure libraries and frameworks, handling sensitive data, error handling, logging, and security in the development environment. This document is essential for maintaining high-quality, secure code in your software project. All team members should understand and follow the guidelines it provides to ensure consistent and secure development practices. 

## Security and Best practices

In this, the lab introduces OpenID Connect (OIDC), a protocol that allows GitHub Actions workflows to securely access Azure resources without storing Azure credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets. The document guides the user through the process of configuring Azure to trust GitHub's OIDC as a federated identity.

## Integrate GitHub with Azure DevOps

This lab explains the process of integrating GitHub with Azure DevOps enabling seamless linking of GitHub pull requests to Azure Boards. This integration streamlines project management by allowing you to track development progress, automate work item updates, and ensure better collaboration. By linking pull requests to work items, you can maintain clear visibility and traceability of code changes, ensuring that every change is associated with a specific task or bug, thereby enhancing the efficiency and organization of your development workflow.
