## Workflow Setup

In this, you'll learn the fundamentals of GitHub Actions and workflow files. We'll cover how to trigger workflows with events like pushes and pull requests, define jobs and steps within workflows, and set up a basic CI workflow for testing code on every push.

## Action Integration

In this, focuses on incorporating pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace and creating custom actions for reusable tasks. You'll learn how to leverage third-party actions to streamline your workflows, with a practical example of deploying a Docker container to a cloud platform.

## Best Practices and Security

In this, we'll discuss guidelines for writing efficient and maintainable workflows, as well as securing sensitive data like API keys and credentials. You'll explore examples of optimizing workflow performance by caching dependencies to ensure smooth operations.

## Advanced Usage and Integration

In this, dives into advanced features of GitHub Actions, including matrix builds and parallelism. You'll also learn how to integrate with GitHub features such as pull requests and issue tracking, with a hands-on example of setting up a matrix build to test across different operating systems and versions.
