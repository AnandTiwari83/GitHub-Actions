4. [Security and Best practices](#security-and-best-practices)

## Workflow Setup

In this, you'll learn the fundamentals of GitHub Actions and workflow files. We'll cover how to trigger workflows with events like pushes and pull requests, define jobs and steps within workflows, and set up a basic CI workflow for testing code on every push.

## Action Integration

In this, focuses on incorporating pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace and creating custom actions for reusable tasks. You'll learn how to leverage third-party actions to streamline your workflows, with a practical example of deploying a Docker container to a cloud platform.

## Advanced Workflows

In this topics like coding standards, secure coding practices, code review processes, version control systems, automated testing strategies, CI/CD practices, secure libraries and frameworks, handling sensitive data, error handling, logging, and security in the development environment. This document is essential for maintaining high-quality, secure code in your software project. All team members should understand and follow the guidelines it provides to ensure consistent and secure development practices.

## Security and Best practices

In this, lab introduces OpenID Connect (OIDC), a protocol that allows GitHub Actions workflows to securely access Azure resources without storing Azure credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets. The document guides the user through the process of configuring Azure to trust GitHub's OIDC as a federated identity.
